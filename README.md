# About

This repository aims to contain solutions for the several coding activities at [Practice/GeeksForGeeks](http://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/), an interactive subdomain to a portal dedicated to Computer Science and correlated professional development.

## Navigation

Challenges are separated by difficulty levels, each providing sorted point rewards towards the website's leaderboard upon submitting the code over the G4GPractice interface.

A way a participant could pick an appropriate category for them is suggested as follows:

From [http://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/pickACategory.php?ref=home](http://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/pickACategory.php?ref=home)

>_The Following are the top solved problems from each category. 
If one is able to solve all five problems of a picked category, 
then he/she may directly jump to next level category. 
If not, then one should continue with the picked category and start practicing more questions._ 

Completed challenges will be pushed to this repository under the respective challenge difficulty folder, challenge name and the used language subfolder.

Available languages for the G4GPractice interface:
* C (gcc 5.4)
* C++ (g++ 5.4)
* Java (1.8)
* Python 3
